    <p>The latest news from Forbes</p>


    <p>Less than a month after reaching the pinnacle of a $200 billion net worth for the third time in late April, 
    Amazon founder Jeff Bezos can no longer claim to be the richest person in the world. He now has a neighbor at the top spot: French billionaire Bernard Arnault, the head of luxury goods group LVMH, 
ended the day $800 million richer—with a net worth of $186 billion—after the company’s shares closed nearly half a percent higher in Europe. On the other side of the Atlantic, 
    Amazon stock dropped by a little more than 1% on Friday, shaving $2.3 billion from Bezos’ net worth and placing both men at the $186 billion mark.</p>
